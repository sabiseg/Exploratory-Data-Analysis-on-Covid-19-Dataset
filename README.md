## Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on COVID-19 datasets to understand global and regional trends of Covid-19.  
The analysis focuses on confirmed, death, recovered, and active cases across different countries and states.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Johns Hopkins CSSE COVID-19 Data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
- **Sample File Used:** `04-12-2020.csv`

---

## Key Objectives
1. Display and inspect dataset structure and missing values.
2. Summarize confirmed, deaths, recovered, and active cases globally and by country.
3. Analyze COVID-19 data at:
   - **Global Level**
   - **Country/Region Level**
   - **Province/State Level**
4. Visualize trends using line plots and bar charts.

## Analysis Performed
- **Q1:** Display dataset preview, info, and missing values.  
- **Q2 - Q4:** Summarize cases by country and province (China-specific breakdown).  
- **Q5 - Q8:** Identify death and recovery patterns across countries.  
- **Q9:** Top 10 countries by confirmed cases.  
- **Q10 - Q13:** Visualizations of cases (Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered, Active) by country and USA states.  
- **Q14:** Worldwide confirmed cases over time.

## Visualizations
- Line plots for global trends.  
- Bar charts for USA state-wise breakdowns.  
- Combined case visualizations by country.
